        <h2>Hello Huỳnh Bảo Lộc</h2>
        <p>In the future, I would like to live in a better world. First and for most, there will be no homeless people, no poverty and social vices. All people will have jobs and income to live on their own. As a result, the rate of unemployment will decrease.
            Secondly, people in the world will live in peace, no war, no violence and inequality. All nations will join hands to build a whole new world. Furthermore, the world’s citizens will utilize environment friendly equipment. Instead of burning
            fossil fuels for energy, people use alternatives like wind and solar power. Electric vehicle will replace nowadays vehicle to reduce air pollution, electricity will be generated by wind, solar panels or wave without damaging the environment.
            Besides, modern systems of public transport run by electricity will be developed to stop congestions and with higher speed,they can help people to commute faster and attract them to use more. And last but not least, I’d like my world to be
            friendly to nature. More trees and flowers will be grown everywhere, deforestations will disappear and the endangered species will be protected thoroughly. Although my wanted world seems to be difficult to achieve, but I believe that when
            we join hands and make efforts, nothing is impossible</p>
